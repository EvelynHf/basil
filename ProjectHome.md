Basil is a programming language development framework and tool set implemented in Python with the goal of enabling/enhancing multi-language programming in addition to language development.  This is the _same_ project as the [SourceForge project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/basil), and will be using [Google Code](http://code.google.com/) for an alternate subversion repository and wiki.
